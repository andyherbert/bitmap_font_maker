This is a prototype textmode font editor, obviously it's a bit useless at the
moment, but I'll keep chipping away at it.

Keys are:

'-' and '=' to zoom in and out.
Keep held down '1' and '2' for 1x and 2x zoom.
Grid toggle is 'g'.
fit to screen is '0'.
pixel brush is 'p'.
Fill is 'f'.
undo redo is cmd z, cmd shift-z on mac and ctrl z, ctrl y everywhere else.
