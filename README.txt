This is a prototype textmode font editor, obviously it's a bit useless at the
moment, but I'll keep chipping away at it.

Keys are:

Ctrl/Cmd + '-' and Ctrl/Cmd + '=' to zoom in and out.
Grid toggle is Ctrl/Cmd + g.
fit to screen is Ctrl/Cmd + 0.
pixel brush is Ctrl/Cmd + p.
Fill is Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + p.
undo is Ctrl/Cmd + z.
redo is Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + z on macOS and Ctrl + y everywhere else.
move around with Ctrl/Cmd + arrow keys
to move with the mouse press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + 'm'.
Pressing the key will take you to the relevant glyph.
